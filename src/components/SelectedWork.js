                        Fitness instructors have a lot to work on, not just classes but, 
                        working with people, with their goals, not only changing their body 
                        but their minds.

                        Trainers are looking for something that it can be with them all the time, 
                        always up to date with whatâ€™s going on with their clients, and removing that 
                        layer of awkwardness to go and ask for the payments.
